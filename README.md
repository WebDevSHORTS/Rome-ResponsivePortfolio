# Rome - Responsive landing page portfolio

Hi everyone!
In this project I will build a responsive landing page portfolio from scratch with a little bit help of our best pal Bootstrap. We will use HTML5, CSS3 and a bit of jQuery.
Watch the tutorials series on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6094NnwVFU&list=PLy0LQzDrrrzixsO7v5Gdckca4NKgz5wF7).

## Usage

##### For every tutorial I created a branch:
- 1.HomeSection ([YT link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6094NnwVFU)): First section of our landing page, the HOME section.
- 2.AboutMeSection ([YT link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq0bryP-zAo)): Here we are gonna create an ABOUT ME section with some skills progress bars.
- 3.CustomizedNavbar ([]()): Bootstrap's hamburger menu is boring. Let's change that using hamburger.css from our friend [jonush](https://github.com/jonsuh/hamburgers).
